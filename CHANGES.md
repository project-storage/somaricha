# Changes Made to Register Component and Authentication Service

## Overview
This document explains the changes made to improve the register functionality in the client application, including adding password visibility toggle and fixing the API integration.

## 1. Password Visibility Toggle Feature

### Changes Made
- Added `FaEye` and `FaEyeSlash` icons from react-icons to the Register component
- Implemented state management for password visibility toggles:
  - `showPassword` for the main password field
  - `showConfirmPassword` for the confirm password field
- Added eye icon buttons to both password fields that allow users to toggle visibility
- Updated the input fields to dynamically change type between "password" and "text" based on visibility state

### Files Modified
- `client/src/pages/auth/Register.tsx`

### Implementation Details
- Added conditional rendering for eye/eye-slash icons based on visibility state
- Positioned toggle buttons absolutely at the right side of each password input field
- Used React state to track and update visibility status
- Maintained proper padding on input fields to accommodate the toggle buttons

## 2. Register Service Integration Fix

### Problem Identified
The client-side register form was sending incorrect field names to the server API:
- Client was sending: `username`, `email`, `tel`, `password`
- Server was expecting: `username`, `password`, `user_name`, `user_lastname`, `email`

### Changes Made
#### Register Component Updates (`client/src/pages/auth/Register.tsx`)
- Updated the `RegisterData` interface to include `user_name` and `user_lastname` fields
- Added initial state values for the new fields
- Added input fields for "First Name" and "Last Name" to the form
- Updated the validation logic to require all necessary fields
- Modified the `authService.register()` call to send the correct field names matching the server API
- Updated form validation to require `username`, `email`, `user_name`, `user_lastname`, `password`, and `confirmPassword`

#### Service Integration
- Verified that the `authService.ts` interface already matched server expectations
- The `authService.register()` method remained unchanged as it was already properly implemented

### Field Mapping
The following field mapping is now in place:
- `username` → username (as expected by server)
- `email` → email (as expected by server)
- `user_name` → user_name (first name, new field added)
- `user_lastname` → user_lastname (last name, new field added)
- `password` → password (as expected by server)

## 3. Form Improvements
- Added proper validation for all required fields
- Maintained the password confirmation check
- Kept the terms agreement checkbox functionality

## 4. Testing Considerations
The changes ensure that:
- Password visibility can be toggled for better user experience
- All required fields are captured and sent to the server in the correct format
- Form validation prevents submission with missing required fields
- The API integration now works correctly with the backend service
